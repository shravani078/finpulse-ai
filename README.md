## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB connection string — either a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) cluster or a local `mongod` instance.

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> finpulse-ai
cd finpulse-ai

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

**backend/.env** (copy from `backend/.env.example`):
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/finpulse
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**frontend/.env** (copy from `frontend/.env.example`):
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. (Optional) Seed demo data

Populates a demo account with ~4 months of realistic transactions, budgets, and savings goals so the dashboard, charts, and AI insights all have something to show immediately.

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```
This creates:
- **Email:** `demo@finpulse.ai`
- **Password:** `Demo@1234`

### 4. Run the app

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (http://localhost:5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend (http://localhost:5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, log in with the demo account (or register your own), and explore.

## 🧠 How the "AI" works

There's no external LLM call — the **AI Spending Coach** and **Financial Health Score** are deterministic, explainable rules run over your own transactions in `backend/utils/insightsEngine.js`:
- Month-over-month category deltas (±20% triggers an insight)
- Budget adherence (80% warning, 100%+ exceeded)
- Top-category savings-potential tip (15% trim suggestion)
- Recurring-overspend detection across consecutive months
- Health score = weighted savings rate + budget adherence + expense consistency + income stability + emergency-fund coverage

This keeps the feature fully functional out of the box, with no API key required. If you'd like to swap in a real LLM later, `getInsights` in `insightsController.js` is the place to do it.
